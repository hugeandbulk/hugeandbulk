What Does Hair Type Mean?

Hair type can be determined by your hair's curl pattern. Our chief dermatologist Dr. Harish Koutam says, "Determining your hair type is essential to choose the right hair care products. Not every product will be well-fit for your hair. Your unique hair type deserves a customized hair care regimen that caters to your individual hair needs. For example, maintaining coily hair requires a lot of conditioning, unlike straight hair.” The amount of curling is based on your hair follicle's shape.

How To Determine Your Hair Type?

1. Straight Hair

If your hair falls flat from the roots to the tips, you have straight hair. The hair texture is soft and silky, with no curls. Straight hair type often has a high amount of oil secretion. Straight hair is subdivided into:

Type 1A - This hair type is extremely soft, smooth and shiny. While this hair may feel like a dream for many, it lacks volume.
Type 1B - slightly thicker and bouncier than 1A.
Type 1C - Most coarse and thick straight hair.

2. Wavy Hair

Wavy hair lies between straight and curly. There is a slight curl pattern at the ends of your hair. However, it is not entirely curly. This hair type is subdivided into:

2A - Thin, wavy hair
2B - Wavy hair with medium thickness
2C - Thick and wavy hair

3. Curly Hair

Check if your hair strands have an 'S' pattern. Curly hair has an 'S' pattern and stays curly irrespective of straightening processes. It is frizzy and prone to tangles. Curly hair is subdivided into:

Type 3A - has loose curls
Type 3B - has medium curls
Type 3C - has tight curls

4. Coily Hair

Coily hair follows a 'z' pattern. It may seem rough and coarse and is prone to breakage. It has very tight curls. Coily hair is subdivided into:

Type 4A - is soft
Type 4B - is wiry
Type 4C - is extremely wiry

How To Care For And Style Your Hair?

1. Straight Hair

Straight hair tends to become oily and flat. It is best to avoid heavy serums and butters. Washing your hair too often can lead to the production of more oils on the scalp. Dry shampoos and texture sprays are a safe best for people with straight hair.

Best suited hairstyle:

Chin-length blunt cut.

Type 1A:

Since this hair lacks volume, go for layer cuts to add a voluminous feel.

Type 1B:

Go for updos and slicked back looks.

Type 1C:

Consider layered cuts and short hair styles.

2. Wavy Hair

Type 2A:

Hair is usually straight from the roots to eye level. From the eye level to the ends, there are loose waves. You don't want to flatten those waves, but define them. Use gels and steer clear of creams and oil-based hair care products.

Type 2B:

Hair is curly from around the eye level to the ends. To highlight these curls using balayage, you may consider dying your hair strands where there is an 's' pattern. Balayage is the technique of free-hand painting highlights onto the hair.

Type 2C:

With this type, defined S shaped curls begin at the crown. Type 2C hair is frizzy. So use a diffuser when blow drying, so that the heat does not end up making the hair more frizzy.

3. Curly Hair

Type 3A:

This kind of hair has S-shaped curls and form loose loops. In order to retain the natural texture, don't brush your hair harshly. The best suited hairstyle for you is a loose ponytail.

Type 3B:

These curls are slightly thicker than type 3A and lack moisture. Add a lot of moisturizing ingredients like aloe vera, shea butter, etc. to your hair. Avoid sulfates and silicones as these can strip off the natural moisture.

Type 3C:

These curls are tight and coil perfectly. Use a leave-in conditioner to untangle hair as this type of hair is prone to breakage.

4. Coily Hair

Type 4A:

Type 4A coily hair is a delicate hair type that needs a lot of moisturization. Consider deep conditioners, butters and creams besides oils. Avoid tight braids at any cost.

Type 4B:

This hair type may follow a zig-zag pattern and is prone to tangles. Use a leave-in conditioner on damp hair and comb your hair gently by separating out sections. This ensures that all of your hair gets the moisture that it needs. You can keep your coils intact using a curling cream or gel.

Type 4C:

This kind of hair has really tight and fragile curls. Use oils, shea butter creams and deep conditioners to keep the hair strands well moisturized. Avoid brushing your hair harshly.

### Wrapping Up

Hair types are based on the way your hair curls. Straight, wavy, curly and coily hair are basic hair types with further subtypes. The more they curl, higher the moisturization your hair needs. Consult your stylist for the best products and hairstyles for your hair type.
