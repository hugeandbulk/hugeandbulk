What Does Hair Type Mean?

Hair type can be determined by your hair's curl pattern. Our chief dermatologist Dr. Harish Koutam says, "Determining your hair type is essential to choose the right hair care products. Not every product will be well-fit for your hair. Your unique hair type deserves a customized hair care regimen that caters to your individual hair needs. For example, maintaining coily hair requires a lot of conditioning, unlike straight hair.” The amount of curling is based on your hair follicle's shape. Oval or asymmetrical follicles give rise to curlier hair. There are 4 basic hair types namely:

Straight

Wavy

Curly

Coily

The subtypes of hair are based on the tightness of the curls or coils.
