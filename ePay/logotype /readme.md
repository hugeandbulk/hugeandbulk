About Logotype 
---------------
A logotype (also called wordmark) is a logo that uses only the brand's name. A logotype is a great option for brands that are looking for name recognition. Logotypes provide more space for information about a company, and can often allow room for a slogan. Related Terms: Brand, Branding, Logo, Logomark, Typeface.

Examples for logotypes include Visa, Coca Cola or Google. The name can be designed in a picturesque or stylistic font, but at its heart it's still just text. Examples for logomarks (or pictorial marks) are the Apple logo, the Twitter bird or Target's target.
