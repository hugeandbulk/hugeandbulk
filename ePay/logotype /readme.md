About Logotype

What is the definition of a logotype?
_noun_. logo·​type ˈlȯ-gə-ˌtīp. ˈlä- 1. : a single piece of type or a single plate faced with a term (such as the name of a newspaper or a trademark)

Examples for logotypes include Visa, Coca Cola or Google. The name can be designed in a picturesque or stylistic font, but at its heart it's still just text. Examples for logomarks (or pictorial marks) are the Apple logo, the Twitter bird or Target's target.
